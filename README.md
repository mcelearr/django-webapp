Simple webapp designed as a replacement for freecycle.com. Uses Django (python framework) to provide CRUD, auth and MVC and bootstrap for styling. Used [Try Django 1.9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfgsklK_yFo&list=PLEsfXFp6DpzQFqfCur9CJ4QnKQTVXUsRy) as a base for development.

## User flow 1 (donor)

I go to the website homepage and press the register button. I create a new account and am now logged in as a user. I go to my dashboard and click the add item button. I add an item title and description and upload a photograph. The post is now visible to other users

## User flow 2 (scrounger)

I go to the website homepage and see all the listings. I click on a listing I like the look of and sign in to contact the donor.
